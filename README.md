A brand that connects beauty industry to the customer. They were in a need for change in their online branding, so me and other UX designer connected our skills to create a beautiful appearance for their marketing campaign. Wordpress is used for CMS, so all the information and visual material on the website can be modified anytime the company wishes so. For the brand filter I have used other framework as a base, but the functionality was improved with pure Vanilla JS. See the brand page here - https://beauty-to-retail.co.uk/
